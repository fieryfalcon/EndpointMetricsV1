This command starts the react application which is embedded into the electron desktop app.

Make sure you run the react app in a 3001 port if the 3000 port is already in use by the PSA frontend

### `npm run start-electron`

This command launches the electron app in your PC.If you are running in 3001 make sure you change it in the main.js file as well.
